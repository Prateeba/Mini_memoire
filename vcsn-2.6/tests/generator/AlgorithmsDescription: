Algorithms implements: 

Generator_random4 : 

- Generate a transducer using the random_automaton algorithm with the highest transition desisty.
- Loop till the number of useful states of the generated transducer is not equal to the number of 
- useful states passed as paramerter. 
- While looping, test if the generated tranducer respect the properties demanded: 
	If not -> select a random transition and repeat the test 

How to use : 

from 1 - 100 states : 
The density can be of 0,9 

from 5000 states : 
density : 0.0001
